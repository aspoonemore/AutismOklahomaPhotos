# AutismOklahomaPhotos

This is a sample project I'm using to teach a Coding Class with Autism Oklahoma. They're learning HTML, CSS and Javascript by building an Ionic mobile app!

## Getting Started With the Project

1. Install Node.JS
   - Instructions at https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/environment
2. Install Ionic CLI (Command line integration) globally
   - npm install -g @ionic/cli
3. Kick off the project
   - ionic serve (opens in browser)
